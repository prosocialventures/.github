## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[Snowpack](https://snowpack.money) is building a personal finance ecosystem that puts your ownership and control of your financial data at the core of everything we do. We're so committed to [this principle](https://snowpack.money/data-stewardship) that we incorporated as a Public Benefit Corporation and put it directly in our articles of incorporation so we're legally obligated to enforce it.

We're starting by building a personal financial data warehouse that you own and control, containing transaction data across all your checking, credit card, and investment accounts. How this data is used and shared with apps is fully under your control.

Our first application is an envelope budgeting app that helps you manage your monthly budget in an easy, intuitive way.
