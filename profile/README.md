## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're doing business in a different way, serving not just shareholders, but all of our stakeholders:
our employees, our customers, our communities, and our planet.

To learn with us as we incubate our first products and discover the most effective ways to deliver on the
[triple bottom line](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-the-triple-bottom-line), connect with us on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/prosocialgroup) or sign up for our [newsletter](https://prosocial.ventures/).

We might not have a lot of public repos just yet, mostly incubating new products in private at this point,
but looking forward to contributing back to open source soon!
